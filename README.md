# Jdo Util Wrapper
An simple wrapper for AppEngine datastore operations using JDO. Its not built in any intention to replace anything, writing some many line repeatedly for soame operations is really pain, So this library just wraps most frequently used jdo operations in simple one line method call. Use it if you find it useful.

## Features

- Simple method calls for frequently operations 
- Type inferred method
- Easy Query Builder
- Independent componets, so you can split up as u need

- currently u can manually download the jar file here [JdoUtil-0.0.1.jar](https://github.com/ramesh-dev/JdoUtil/blob/master/src/dist/JdoUtil-0.0.1.jar)
